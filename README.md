<h1>MCcoords</h1>
I like placing a path of torches to link portals on the Nether roof, so I made this program to make the paths straight.

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
I did a lot of guess-and-checking to figure out how to convert between conventional angles in radians to minecraft angles in degrees.
Just give standard input of two integers separated with a space followed by ctrl-D and the program will print out the angle.
